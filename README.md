# Main Resume

* A simple resume for personal use.*

Sometimes the resume itself might differ, because I play around with the branches.

Only one of the versions is available in a live environment.

The current available versions are:
1. an old, first theme;
2. a minimalistic JS/CSS/HTML version;
3. a minimalistic Jekyll version;
4. a minimalistic Flask version.

The old version is based [on this](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/resume) bootstrap theme.
The other minimalistic versions are inspired from [this template](https://github.com/jglovier/resume-template).
